## 📌 Project Overview

This project detects whether a news article is **fake or real** using machine learning techniques such as **Logistic Regression** and **Multinomial Naive Bayes**.

We used a publicly available dataset containing news articles labeled as `Fake` or `True`.

---

## ✅ Dataset

- Fake news from `Fake.csv`
- Real news from `True.csv`
- Combined and cleaned → `cleaned_news.csv` (not pushed to GitHub)
- Preprocessing: lowercasing, punctuation removal, lemmatization, stopword removal

---

## 🔠 Text Vectorization

- Used **TF-IDF vectorizer** from scikit-learn
- Converted `clean_text` column into numerical vectors
- Trained models on `X_train`, tested on `X_test`

---

## 🧠 Models Trained

### 🔹 Logistic Regression  
### 🔸 Multinomial Naive Bayes  

Both achieved ~98% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

### 🔽 Confusion Matrix
### 🔽 Metric Bar Chart
### 🔴 Fake News Word Cloud
### 🟢 Real News Word Cloud

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes performed similarly
- Word clouds clearly show vocabulary differences
- The model is now ready to be deployed or used on new articles
