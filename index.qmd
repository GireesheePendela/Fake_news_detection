## 📌 Project Overview

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to detect whether a given news article is **real** or **fake** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and supervised machine learning models.

We use a labeled dataset of real and fake news articles to:
- Preprocess and clean the text
- Convert it into numerical features using **TF-IDF Vectorization**
- Train models such as **Logistic Regression** and **Multinomial Naive Bayes**
- Evaluate performance using standard classification metrics
- Visualize insights like confusion matrices, word clouds, and top predictive words

### 🔍 Problem Statement

Fake news can spread rapidly and influence public opinion. This project focuses on building a model that can automatically distinguish between fake and real news articles based on textual content.

### 📦 Dataset

The dataset consists of:
- `Fake.csv`: News articles labeled as **fake**
- `True.csv`: News articles labeled as **real**

The two datasets are combined and labeled (0 = fake, 1 = real), then cleaned and preprocessed for modeling.
