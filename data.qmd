### 🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project comes from [Kaggle: Fake and Real News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset), and consists of two separate CSV files:

- **`Fake.csv`** — Contains news articles that are labeled as **fake**
- **`True.csv`** — Contains news articles that are labeled as **real**

Each file includes the following columns:
- `title`: The headline of the news article
- `text`: The body/content of the article
- `subject`: Topic category (e.g., politics, world news)
- `date`: Publication date

## 🔗 Combining the Dataset

To train a supervised machine learning model, we need a single labeled dataset. So we:

1. Assigned a new column called `label`:
   - `0` for **fake** articles
   - `1` for **real** articles
2. Used `pandas.concat()` to combine both datasets into one DataFrame
3. Shuffled the rows to randomize the ordering
4. Saved the result as `combined_news.csv`

This ensures a balanced and properly labeled dataset for training and testing.

## 🧹 Text Cleaning and Preprocessing

To make the raw news content usable for modeling, we applied several text preprocessing steps on the `text` column:

- **Lowercasing** all words
- **Removing punctuation** and special characters
- **Tokenizing** into words
- **Removing stopwords** (e.g., “the”, “and”, “is”)
- **Lemmatizing** words (e.g., “running” → “run”)

The cleaned text was stored in a new column called `clean_text`, and the final preprocessed dataset was saved as `cleaned_news.csv`.

These steps help reduce noise and ensure that the model learns from meaningful textual features.
